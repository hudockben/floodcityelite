# Flood City Elite — Member Portal

A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) (App Router) app with a branded home/login
screen backed by a [Neon](https://neon.tech) Postgres database. Members sign in
with a **company code**, **username**, and **password**.

- Home screen (`/`) — the Flood City Elite login.
- Member area — a protected tabbed shell (Homeplate, Teams, Payment Tracker,
  Budgets, Fundraiser Tracker, Program/Camps, Schedules, Contact Info, Yard
  Tournaments, Hotels, Inventory) shown after a successful login and guarded by
  middleware.
- Auth — passwords are hashed with **bcrypt**; the session is a signed
  (JWT, HS256) **httpOnly** cookie.

## Login credentials

| Field        | Value                                                            |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Company code | `fce`                                                            |
| Username     | `admin` (default seed username)                                  |
| Password     | your `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, or a strong random one generated and printed once by `npm run db:setup` |

> The company code for Flood City Elite is always `fce`. The admin password is
> never hardcoded — set your own via `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` or use the one the
> seed step prints, and change it after first login.

## Database tables

Five tables back the app (see [`db/schema.sql`](db/schema.sql)):

- **`companies`** — one row per organization. Login matches on `code`
  (e.g. `fce`).
- **`users`** — belongs to a company via `company_id`. A username is unique
  *within* a company. Stores `password_hash`, `role`, `is_active`, and
  `last_login_at`.
- **`teams`** — belongs to a company. Each team lives in a `division`
  (`spring-summer-baseball`, `softball`, or `fall-baseball`) and is assigned a
  `sport` (`baseball` or `softball`). This powers the **Teams** tab.
- **`players`** — roster rows that belong to a team via `team_id`
  (`ON DELETE CASCADE`). Only `player_name` is required; the rest (grad year,
  date of birth, height, weight, positions, high school, parent contact,
  closest facility) can be filled in over time.
- **`payments`** — payments logged against a player via `player_id`
  (`ON DELETE CASCADE`). Each row records `paid_on`, a `payment_type` (`check`
  or `cash`), an optional `check_number` (for check payments), and an `amount`.
  This powers the **Payment Tracker** tab, whose Total column accumulates the
  payments received.

## Getting started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment** — copy the example and fill it in:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

   - `DATABASE_URL` — your Neon connection string (Neon console → **Connect** →
     pooled connection string).
   - `SESSION_SECRET` — a random secret: `openssl rand -base64 32`.

3. **Create the tables and seed the admin user**

   ```bash
   npm run db:setup
   ```

   This creates the tables, ensures the `fce` company exists, and creates the
   default admin user. It prints the credentials when it finishes.

   > Prefer to do it by hand? Paste [`db/schema.sql`](db/schema.sql) into the
   > Neon **SQL Editor** instead — then create a user with a bcrypt hash.

4. **Run the app**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open <http://localhost:3000> and sign in.

## Adding more users

Each user belongs to the `fce` company. To add one, insert a row into `users`
with a bcrypt-hashed password. The quickest way is to reuse the seed pattern in
[`db/setup.mjs`](db/setup.mjs), or generate a hash:

```bash
node -e "import('bcryptjs').then(b => b.default.hash(process.argv[1], 10).then(console.log))" 'their-password'
```

then:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (company_id, username, password_hash, full_name, role)
VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM companies WHERE code = 'fce'),
  'coach', '<paste-hash>', 'Coach Name', 'coach'
);
```
